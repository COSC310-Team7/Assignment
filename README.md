This project is on a conversational agent that takes word or sentence input from a user and outputs an appropriate response. Our specific conversational agent is a computer tech support agent that answers hardware and software related issues. The program specifically takes in an input, gets a list of synonyms of the input, matches one of the synonyms to our intent, then generates the appropriate response based on the intent. The program was written in Python and generating these synomyns were done with Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) and wordnet.
